#### dreams and schemes:
* tests...
* pull tonal stuff out of key-layout.
  - make a key/frequency property that could be a function, array or object.
  - a function would dynamically associate frequencies to keys
* clean up key events/handlers.
* better lightup api.
  - different colors for different channels?
  - per key styles?
  - envelopes for colors and tones
* make transitions easier to follow
  - fade black/white keys
* simpler definition for width vs. stroke ratio
* smooth transition for viewbox so that kb is always in the middle
* demo with [this badass dx7 emulator](https://github.com/mmontag/dx7-synth-js)
* lil-synth gain
* make lil-synth a separate project
* styles
